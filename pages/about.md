## About This Archive

Family archives are strange, in that we always have to choose a place to start, and we are limited by the collections we have access to. This collection has Forrest and Margaret Miller King as its center, though there are items in the collection that clearly point backwards and forwards in time, too. The objects here are also just a sampling of what the wider family has. 

Based on a box of items given to me by Aunt Gwen to archive in 2019 after Grandma's passing, I've chosen samples of items that help trace Forrest and Margaret's growing family as well as document the German Mennonite heritage as it manifests in the German school reader and the Miller family's German-language Bible. I hope to add more items as I can to deepen the scope and to trace more branches of the family, as well as make corrections on the historical data as necessary.

Many thanks to all the family members who have shared and helped me track down information!

Lisa King
